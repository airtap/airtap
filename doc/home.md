airtap is the easiest way to test javascript across all browsers.

Once you have done the [installation](./installation.md), proceed to the [quickstart](./quickstart.md) to write your first test.

Airtap will do all the hard work of setting up your test harness, support files, and cloud browser integration so you can just focus on writing your tests.
