# .airtap.yml

The `.airtap.yml` file lives in each project directory and contains per-project test settings.

## fields

### browsers (required)

List of browsers to test in the cloud. Each entry starts with a `- name` field and must contain a `version` field and an optional `platform` field. If the platform field is omitted, a default platform will be selected.

A browser version can be a specific version number, the keyword `latest`, the keyword `oldest`, or (for Firefox and Chrome) one of the keywords `beta`  or `dev`.

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: chrome
    version: latest
  - name: safari
    version: latest
```

#### Specific version of a browser on a specific platform

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: chrome
    version: 28
    platform: Windows XP
```

#### Range of versions of a browser

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: firefox
    version: 14..latest
```

#### Range of versions with negative start index.

This example would test the latest three stable versions of Firefox (latest - 2, latest - 1, latest).

``` yaml
browsers:
  - name: firefox
    version: -2..latest
```

#### Disjoint versions

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: firefox
    version: [19, 20]
```

#### Disjoint with ranges

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: firefox
    version: [19, 20, 23..latest]
  - name: chrome
    version: [-1..latest, beta]
```

#### Float version numbers

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: iPhone
    version: '8.0..latest'
```

Float version numbers should be quoted.

### browserify (optional)

You can set any of the configuration elements in the list below, and they'll be passed to `browserify`.

- `plugin`
- `external`
- `ignore`
- `exclude`
- `transform`
- `add`
- `require`

You can pass options to any of them, and you can use multiples as the configuration object is treated as an array!

```yaml
browserify:
  - plugin: proxyquire-universal
  - require: ./some-file.js
    expose: intimidate
    entry: true
  - external: ./some-module.js
  - transform: brfs
  - transform: jadeify
```

You can also configure what's passed as the `opts` to `browserify(opts)` by adding an item with the `options` property.

```yaml
browserify:
  - transform: coffeeify
  - options:
      extensions:
        - .js
        - .json
        - .coffee
```

Transform options can also be provided like so:

```yaml
browserify:
  - transform:
      name: reactify
      es6: true # option passed to reactify
  - transform: 6to5ify
```

### server (optional)

This field can point to an optional shell command or javascript file to run as a testing support server. This is used to make testing with real ajax and websocket requests possible. Your command will be run with the `AIRTAP_SUPPORT_PORT` environment variable set to a port number you MUST use. If your server does not listen on this PORT then your test requests won't be able to reach it.

```yaml
server: ./test/support/server.js
```

We recommend writing simple support servers using [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/). However, any shell command will be run so servers in ruby, python, etc are also supported. $AIRTAP_SUPPORT_PORT can also be used as part of the arguments, enabling the use of command-line http servers:

```yaml
# Assuming python is installed
server: "python -m SimpleHTTPServer $AIRTAP_SUPPORT_PORT"
# If http-server is available, e.g. npm install -g http-server
server: "http-server -p $AIRTAP_SUPPORT_PORT"
```

### firefox_profile (optional)

Selenium (and Sauce Labs) support running Firefox instances with custom user profiles. This allows you to configure anything you can change in `about:config` programmatically for a test run. In `airtap`, you can set these options in `.airtap.yml` with a section under any Firefox browser entry. For instance:

```yaml
browsers:
  - name: firefox
    version: latest
    firefox_profile:
      webgl.force-enabled: true
```

YAML values within the `firefox_profile` section will be transformed into a Firefox profile, zipped, and uploaded to the test worker.
