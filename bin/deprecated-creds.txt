Setting Sauce Labs credentials in .airtap.yml or .airtaprc is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead set the credentials via the environment as SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY respectively, or pass them to the airtap-sauce provider:

  providers:
    - airtap-sauce:
        username: example
        key: secret
